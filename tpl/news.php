                            On Tuesday the 15th October the DataPLANT NFDI consortium submitted it's proposal to the DFG. The consortium in Fundamental Plant Research consists of roughly 30 participants including universities and large research institutions distributed over the country. A significant proportion of the participants originate from Baden-Württemberg and the BioDATEN Science Data Center. Further co-applicants are the Technical University of Kaiserslautern and the Forschungszentrum Jülich.

                        The central aim of the DataPLANT consortium is to advance research data management in it's designated community and generate added value in the field of basic plant research. Successful collaboration and use of data of different modalities – from many sources and experiments, pre-processed or analysed with a variety of algorithms – requires contextualization of the data. The FAIR Data 1 and Linked Open Data Principles provide critical guidelines for research data management. Various consortia have therefore made proposals for best practice and compliance with these principles, but it is almost always the initiative of individual researchers to implement them. Therefore, comprehensive information on the required quality for use by third parties is rarely available. Researchers have been shown to require practical assistance in exploiting the fragmented and complex resource landscape. This increases the need for a tailor-made (infra)structure for research data management. By combining technical expertise in the fields of fundamental plant research, information and computer sciences and infrastructure specialists, DataPLANT will support plant scientists in every RDM concerns. DataPLANT will create a service environment to contextualize research data according to the FAIR principles with minimal additional effort and to support the entire research cycle in modern plant biology. The tailor-made service landscape in DataPLANT will consist of technical-digital assistance as well as on-site personnel assistance. DataPLANT thus creates a central entry point and a valuable subject-specific data and knowledge resource. In combination with teaching and training concepts, data literacy is strengthened and a long-term motivation for the creation of well-indicated data objects is                       generated. By integrating plant science into the NFDI network as a whole, DataPLANT is driving the digital transformation and democratization of research data in the field.

                        In modern hypothesis-driven science, researchers increasingly rely on effective research data management services and infrastructures that facilitate the acquisition, processing, exchange and archival of research data sets, to enable the linking of interdisciplinary expertise and the combination of different analytical results. The immense additional insight obtained through comparative and integrative analyses provides additional value in the examination of research questions that goes far beyond individual experiments. Specifically, in the research area of fundamental plant research that this consortium focuses on, modern approaches need to integrate analyses across different system levels (such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, phenomics). This is necessary to understand system-wide molecular physiological responses as a complex dynamic adjustment of the interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites. As a consequence, a wide range of different technologies as well as experimental and computational methods are employed to pursue state-of-the-art research questions, rendering the research objective a team effort across disciplines. The overall goal of DataPLANT is to provide the research data management practices, tools, and infrastructure to enable such collaborative research in plant biology. In this context, common standards, software, and infrastructure can ensure availability, quality, and interoperability of data, metadata, and data-centric workflows and are thus a key success factor and crucial precondition in barrier-free, high-impact collaborative plant biology research. Toward this, the key objectives pursued by this consortium are:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A specific community standard for fundamental plant research (meta)data and workflow annotation, based on generic, existing and emerging standards (e.g., ISA model, MIAPPE) and ontologies in plant science.</li>
                            <li>Assistive mechanisms and services to build, link and maintain the complete research context during data acquisition, curation, analysis, and publication.</li>
                            <li>Mechanisms for collaborative research based on enrichment and automatized crosslinking of plant-research specific (meta)data to facilitate research context management.</li>
                            <li>A cloud-based open reference implementation of these mechanisms and services, and a central hosted instance thereof.</li>
                            <li>A robust, federated infrastructure both for data computation and management covering the complete data lifecycle.</li>
                            <li>Comprehensive training of community members through workshops and summer schools and providing open training material.</li>
                        </ol>
                        The final grant application is due to the 15th October.

                        The digitalization changes the working habits in almost all scientific disciplines with vast impact on teaching, research and interdisciplinary collaboration. The challenges faced in bioinformatics arising from vastly growing amounts of data are exemplary for a discipline establishing new ways of scientific work and insight. <a target="_blank" href="//galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/">Galaxy</a> as a platform already provides a wide range of tools used by a significant proportion of the community presented in BioDATEN. Through the formed consortium, comprising of bioinformaticians, core facilities, compute centers and libraries, a <a target="_blank" href="//www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/rz/aktuell/2019-sdc-biodaten-kickoff">science data center for life sciences for Baden-Württemberg just got established</a>. The four-year project will report about the anticipated goals and the work plan intended to achieve them in the relevant communities.

                    <p>
                        BioDATEN will heavily depend on the technical infrastructure available through Galaxy and the project partners such as bwSFS, BinAC and bwCloud or the repositories provided by the university libraries in Konstanz and Tübingen. State-wide activities will be orchestrated through the <a target="_blank" href="//www.forschungsdaten.info/">work group on research data management</a>. The SDC creates a multi institutional network among the strongest bioinformatics research sites. The consortium brings together the compute centers of the universities of Freiburg and Tübingen; the DKFZ, the EMBL and the university (BioQuant) in Heidelberg; the university libraries of Konstanz and Tübingen; the Quantitative Biology Center Tübingen; Bioinformatics and Plant Biotechnology Freiburg; CLARIN-D Center Tübingen; Livestock Microbial Ecology Hohenheim; Disease Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics Konstanz; Clinic of Neurology Ulm.

                        The consortium that applied for the funding includes data-using researchers from all life sciences as well as bioinformatic method developers and infrastructure providers. The members of the consortium are leaders in digital data-driven research in life sciences as well as in information scientific questions. Between some of the members, long-lasting bilateral cooperations already exist. These should now be transfered to a consortium. Discipline-specific and information scientific aspects of research data management have already been tackled in shared projects or are part of current cooperation taking place as part of the de.NBI and bwHPC on a national and ELIXIR and Galaxy on an international level.
